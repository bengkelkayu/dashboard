# üöÄ Quick Start Guide: Enhanced GitHub Actions Workflows

## What's New? 

Your GitHub Actions workflows now automatically:
1. ‚úÖ Verify database schema before and after migrations
2. ‚úÖ Test QR code functionality after deployment
3. ‚úÖ Fail deployment on critical errors (instead of just warnings)
4. ‚úÖ Provide detailed status reports

## How to Use

### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

Just push to main branch:
```bash
git push origin main
```

The workflow will:
- ‚úÖ Pull latest code to server
- ‚úÖ Check database schema
- ‚úÖ Run migrations only if needed
- ‚úÖ Verify migrations succeeded
- ‚úÖ Restart application
- ‚úÖ Test QR code functionality
- ‚úÖ Report results

### Manual Deployment

Go to GitHub Actions: `https://github.com/bengkelkayu/dashboard/actions`

**Choose workflow**: "Deploy to VPS" or "Deploy to VPS (Password Auth)"

**Select deploy type**:
- `app-only` - Just update app code (fast, 2-3 min) ‚ö°
- `full` - Install everything + deploy (first time, 10 min)
- `setup-only` - Only install system dependencies

## What to Expect

### ‚úÖ Successful Deployment

You'll see these in the workflow logs:

```
üîç Verifying database schema...
‚úì Schema verification passed - no migrations needed
```

Or if migrations are needed:

```
üîç Verifying database schema...
‚ö†Ô∏è  Schema verification found issues - running migrations...
üóÑÔ∏è  Running database migrations...
‚úì Migrations completed successfully
üîç Re-verifying database schema...
‚úÖ Schema verification passed after migrations!
```

Then at the end:

```
üîç Testing QR Code and WhatsApp API functionality...
‚úì Health check passed
‚úÖ QR Code columns found in database:
   ‚úì qr_code_generated_at
   ‚úì qr_code_token
   ‚úì qr_code_url
‚úÖ invitation_link column found

‚úÖ Deployment verification completed successfully!
```

### ‚ùå Failed Deployment

If something goes wrong, the workflow will STOP and show:

```
‚ùå Schema verification failed after migrations - please check manually
```

Or:

```
‚ùå Migrations failed
Checking migration status...
```

**What to do**: Check the logs above the error for details, then:

1. SSH to server:
   ```bash
   ssh root@43.134.97.90
   cd /root/dashboard
   ```

2. Check schema:
   ```bash
   npm run verify-schema
   ```

3. If needed, run migrations manually:
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

4. Restart app:
   ```bash
   pm2 restart wedding-api
   ```

5. Retry deployment

## Troubleshooting

### "Schema verification found issues"

**This is normal!** The workflow will automatically run migrations.

### "Migrations failed"

**Possible causes**:
- Database connection issue
- Migration already applied (check logs)
- SQL syntax error

**Fix**:
```bash
ssh root@43.134.97.90
cd /root/dashboard

# Check database connection
cat .env | grep DATABASE_URL

# Try manual migration
npm run migrate

# If successful, restart
pm2 restart wedding-api
```

### "QR code columns missing"

**This means** migrations didn't run or failed.

**Fix**:
```bash
ssh root@43.134.97.90
cd /root/dashboard
npm run migrate
npm run verify-schema
pm2 restart wedding-api
```

### Workflow takes longer than before

**Expected!** The enhanced workflow adds:
- Schema verification (3 times): ~15-30 seconds
- QR code testing: ~10-20 seconds

**Total additional time**: 30-60 seconds

**Worth it?** ‚úÖ YES! You get:
- Fewer failed deployments
- No manual fixes needed
- Confidence that QR code feature works

## Monitoring Your Deployment

### View Workflow Status

1. Go to: `https://github.com/bengkelkayu/dashboard/actions`
2. Click on the latest workflow run
3. Watch the steps execute in real-time

### Key Steps to Watch

- **Deploy Application** - Where schema verification happens
- **Verify Deployment** - Where basic health checks run
- **Test QR Code Functionality** - Where QR feature is tested

### Check Application After Deployment

```bash
# Test the deployed app
curl http://43.134.97.90/health

# Check if QR code API works
curl http://43.134.97.90/api/whatsapp/status

# SSH and check logs
ssh root@43.134.97.90
pm2 logs wedding-api --lines 50
```

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO

- Push to main when you want automatic deployment
- Check workflow logs if deployment fails
- Run migrations manually if workflow fails
- Use `app-only` for regular updates (default)
- Use `full` only for first-time setup

### ‚ùå DON'T

- Don't skip checking workflow logs
- Don't ignore schema verification warnings
- Don't deploy if workflow shows errors
- Don't run `full` deployment unnecessarily

## Quick Commands Reference

### On Your Machine
```bash
# Trigger automatic deployment
git push origin main

# Check workflow status
# Go to: https://github.com/bengkelkayu/dashboard/actions
```

### On Server (SSH)
```bash
# SSH to server
ssh root@43.134.97.90

# Navigate to app
cd /root/dashboard

# Verify schema
npm run verify-schema

# Run migrations
npm run migrate

# Check PM2 status
pm2 status

# View logs
pm2 logs wedding-api

# Restart app
pm2 restart wedding-api
pm2 restart wedding-worker
```

## Success Checklist

After deployment completes, verify:

- [ ] Workflow shows "‚úÖ Deployment verification completed successfully!"
- [ ] Workflow shows "‚úÖ QR Code columns found in database"
- [ ] App is accessible at http://43.134.97.90
- [ ] Health endpoint works: `curl http://43.134.97.90/health`
- [ ] PM2 shows processes online: `ssh root@43.134.97.90 pm2 status`
- [ ] No errors in logs: `ssh root@43.134.97.90 pm2 logs wedding-api --lines 20`

## Getting Help

If deployment fails and you can't fix it:

1. **Check workflow logs** - Look for red ‚ùå indicators
2. **Check application logs** - SSH and run `pm2 logs`
3. **Check database** - Run `npm run verify-schema` on server
4. **Check this guide** - Follow troubleshooting steps above
5. **Create an issue** - Include workflow logs and error messages
